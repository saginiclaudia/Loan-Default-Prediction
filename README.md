## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict loan defaults based on various financial and personal characteristics. This project aims to help financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals and manage risk effectively.

## Business and Data Understanding

* Stakeholder: Financial Institution (Bank, Credit Union, etc.)
* Business Problem: Loan defaults can lead to significant financial losses for lending institutions. Predicting loan defaults can help institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals and manage risk effectively.
Data: The project utilizes a loan default prediction dataset containing information about loan applicants and their repayment history. The dataset includes features such as:
Demographic Information: Age, education level, etc.
Financial Information: Debt-to-income ratio, credit score, loan amount, etc.
Loan Details: Loan term, interest rate, etc.
Target Variable: Loan default indicator (e.g., 0 - paid in full, 1 - defaulted)
Methodology

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Analyze the data to understand its distribution, identify missing values, and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
Model Building: Train and evaluate different machine learning algorithms for loan default prediction. Common choices may include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model to enhance its accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the final model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Results

Model Selection: The final model selection will be based on a combination of performance metrics and interpretability for business stakeholders.
Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the models will be evaluated using relevant classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion
This project aims to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in loan default prediction. By building a robust model, lenders can gain valuable insights into borrower risk and make more informed decisions, ultimately mitigating financial risk and improving loan portfolio performance.

Future Work

Explore feature engineering techniques to create new features for potentially better model performance.
Investigate the use of more advanced classification algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines.
Integrate the model into a loan application system for real-time default risk assessment.
